# Attribution Sample for Runtime Quartz SDK iOS 

## About

Since Esri is stating this attribution requirement as a legal requirement based on the Terms of Use, developers will be required to do it in any deployed app. However, the various SDKs provide different levels of support of this service for developers. If not easy, developers may decide to not implement the requirement. Therefore, it is in Esri's and the customer's best interest to make this as easy and painless as possible for developers regardless of which SDK they choose to build their app.
